The fetch of the delegator list and the input of the epoch nonce need to be done independently.

* Get the list of delegators at the epoch change.
* Get the epoch nonce aprox. 1.5 days prior to the next epoch change.
* It is recommended to run the code in jupyter in order to save the delegator list first.
